#Running Lizzie with KataGo

I've seen many posts asking for help on how to run KataGo with Lizzie and I thought I'll write a post about it. Feel free to contribute to this guide as you try to follow along and get your system running.

I will assume that

- You have KataGo configured (see [Setting Up and Running KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo#setting-up-and-running-katago) for details)
- You have Lizzie running (see [Running Lizzie](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie#running-lizzie) for details)
